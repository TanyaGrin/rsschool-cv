## About me:
My main goal is to become a master of the code. I want to understand a complete process of program creation and be the one who can generate cool products and solutions. 

All my life I considered myself *a pure humanist*, unable to go further than 2 + 2. I thought computer technologies were outside of my area of interests and abilities. All my previous experience has been in journalism, advertising and management. Once, *for the sake of idle curiosity*, I began to learn front end. It turned out to be exciting to me. I was surprised, so much so that I decided to go ahead and dive into JS. Now I am at the very beginning of the journey. Here and now I can say that the lack of a technical background is compensated by *strong interest and desire to understand everything in detail*. Experience in learning and working with languages helps me in learning programming languages. Every day I find answers to dozens of questions, and I'm not afraid to ask new ones.

## Skills (in progress):
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Git / GitHub 

## There will be code examples:
TBD
