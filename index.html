              <h2 class="header">About me</h2>
              <p>My main goal is to become a master of the code. I want to understand a complete process of program creation and be the one who can generate cool products and solutions.</p>
              <p>All my life I considered myself a pure humanist, unable to go further than 2 + 2. I thought computer technologies were outside of my area of interests and abilities. All my previous experience has been in journalism, advertising and management. Once, for the sake of idle curiosity, I began to learn front end. It turned out to be exciting to me. I was surprised, so much so that I decided to go ahead and dive into JS. Now I am at the very beginning of the journey. Here and now I can say that the lack of a technical background is compensated by strong interest and desire to understand everything in detail. Experience in learning and working with languages helps me in learning programming languages. <b>Every day I find answers to dozens of questions, and I'm not afraid to ask new ones.</b></p>
